# Argos Plugins

A collection of plugins for the GNOME Shell extension
[Argos](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos).

## Installation

Plugins are the executable files found in "plugins"; the "share" directory
within is required and shared between plugins.

Simply copy the "share" directory and any desired plugins to `~/.config/argos`,
and ensure the plugins are marked with the executable flag.

## Customization

For information on how to customize the position and update interval of plugins,
see [the Argos README](https://github.com/p-e-w/argos#filename-format).

Plugins can be further customized by editing the scripts: customizable settings
will usually be found at the top of the script.
